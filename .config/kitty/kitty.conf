 window_padding_width 10

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.




macos_titlebar_color #5d53d8
# default was `macos_titlebar_color system`

#: The color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value of
#: system means to use the default system color, light or dark can
#: also be used to set it explicitly. A value of background means to
#: use the background color of the currently active window and finally
#: you can use an arbitrary color, such as #525fd9 or red. WARNING:
#: This option works by using a hack when arbitrary color (or
#: background) is configured, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it.
#: It sets the background color of the entire window and makes the
#: titlebar transparent. As such it is incompatible with
#: background_opacity. If you want to use both, you are probably
#: better off just hiding the titlebar with hide_window_decorations.
